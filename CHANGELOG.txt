0.3 for 7.0
Released February 1st, 2019.

    Message file changes:
    * Added "hover.present_tense.ability", default message is "➡ &aIt has the \"&2{1}&a\" ability."
    * Added "hover.past_tense.ability", default message is "➡ &aIt had the \"&2{1}&a\" ability."

    Broadcast file changes:
    * Corrected a small formatting issue on shiny eggs being hatched. (last part of line wasn't bold)
    * Fixed the trade broadcast rarely showing incorrect shiny status for one of the Pokémon.
    * Reworded many broadcasts to preserve consistency even when precursor events aren't announced.

    Additions:
    * Added the showing of abilities to the hover stats!

    Tweaks:
    * Brought a few console messages in line with Even More Pixelmon Commands.
    * Hopefully made it so localized setups end up logging both the localized and English Pokémon names.
    * Readied everything for gen 7!
    * Updated Forge version to build against, from 2705 to 2768. Might fix some issues with flaky toggles.

    Fixes:
    * Fixed /pixelmonbroadcasts not showing commands if something happened to the main command alias.
    * Fixed forfeit messages occasionally reporting bad biomes/coordinates. How did this even work before?
    * Hopefully fixed legendary-related messages not working with non-English names. Sorry for the delay!

0.2.2 for 6.3.4
Released August 18th, 2018.

    Message file changes:
    * Changed "toggle.header" to "&5--------- &dPersonal event toggles (click to change) &5--------".
    * Changed "toggle.boss_trainer.on" to "&a&nleader" to prevent cut-off.
    * Changed "toggle.boss_trainer.off" to "&c&nleader" to prevent cut-off.

    Broadcast file changes:
    * Changed all default mentions of "boss trainer" to "leader" to mirror the above.

    Tweaks:
    * Clarified toggles only applying to the person setting them, to avoid further confusion. See changes.
    * Moved the "shiny legend" toggle so it shows after "shiny" and "legend" if enabled. Bit cleaner.
    * Split the mod's start-up messages into two blocks, with one only showing up if something's wrong.

    Fixes:
    * Fixed hovers on certain challenge messages always being enabled.
    * Fixed the Pixelmon legendary message check not reloading the config immediately after editing it.
    * Hopefully worked around a rare error with battle participants going null when a battle ends.

0.2.1 for 6.3
Released June 10th, 2018.

    Fixes:
    * Fixed %biome% on spawns and catches always showing the biome at 0, 0, 0.
    * Fixed %xpos%, %ypos% and %zpos% not working right.
    * Fixed an odd error where a Pokémon could apparently forfeit a fight with another Pokémon.
    * Fixed normal catch and blackout messages not being toggle-able.
    * Fixed PvP draws referencing two removed "toggle.pvp_draw" keys, and a missing comma.

    Tweaks:
    * Toggle categories now sort mostly alphabetically. Stuff was changing too often to keep up with.

0.2.0 for 6.3
Released June 9th, 2018.

    Permission changes:
    * "pixelmonbroadcasts.notify.trade.normal" is now "pixelmonbroadcasts.notify.trade".
    * All "defeat"-type permissions are now "victory"-type permissions to avoid confusion.
    * PvP "start"/"end" permissions have been merged into the old "challenge"/"victory" groups.

    Fixes:
    * Fixed an issue where old options would occasionally get stuck when reloading with changes made.
    * Fixed some potential bugs with players with edited names. There may be more, please report.
    * Removed a few leftover debug messages when players blacked out to wild Pokémon. Oops.
    * Updated CHANGELOG.txt with missed changes in 0.1.1, and corrected versions.

    Additions:
    * Added a lang option for showing neutral stats in hovers, instead of just "ERROR".
    * Added support for showing catches and blackouts for Pokémon that aren't special.
    * Enabled showing IVs on Pokémon that a player lost to or fled from. Turn off hover to disable.
    * Rewrote configuration/translation with a three-file setup, found in the PixelmonBroadcasts folder.
    * Split up the old detailed "hover" into a more basic "hover" (safe info) and a new "reveal". (IVs)
    * The %world% and %biome% placeholders should now work properly on trainer/PvP broadcasts.
    * Trades now support the showing of shiny Pokémon, using the new %shiny% placeholder.
